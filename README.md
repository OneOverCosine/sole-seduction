![product page and cart ](front-end/src/assets/readMe-images/wireframes2.png)

### Component Hierarchy
We did wireframes for the mobile view of the four pages and then used these to establish the component hierarchy

- Navbar
- Footer
- Home page
  - Hero Image
  - Category card
- Category page
  - Product card
- Product page
  - Product images
  - Product description
- Checkout page
  - Item summary

![product page and cart ](front-end/src/assets/readMe-images/hierarchy2.png)

### User Stories
Our next step, using the original brief and the component hierarchies, was to produce a list of user stories:

### Scrum board
The final part of our planning stage was to add the user stories to the backlog of our scrumboard to organise our workload:
